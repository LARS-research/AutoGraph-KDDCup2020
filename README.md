# AutoGraph

## Introduction
This is the official repo for hosting AutoGraph challenge datasets/code from KDD Cup 2020, targeting automated node classification task. To that end, we provide in this repo 14 datasets from public and private sources to fully evaluate the generalization ability of AutoML algorithms.

## Running locally

We provide full details for evaluating locally. Please download the datasets and put under the folder `src/data`. Then pull the prepared docker `nehzux/kddcup2020:v2` and run command
`docker run --gpus=0 -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/app/autograph" -w /app/autograph nehzux/kddcup2020:v2`

Go to the directory of `run_local_test.py` and run `python run_local_test.py --dataset_dir=data/a --code_dir=code_submission/0_baseline` for testing baseline on dataset a.

## Dataset license:

We include 14 datasets in total here in this repository. 10 datasets come from public datasets and 4 come from 4paradigm. We conclude the licenses for each dataset below.
